# Data Structures in C

Implementation of Data Structures in C.

This repository contains:
- vector: useful when a simple C [] array is needed but without the hassle of reallocating when needed
- array: is an ArrayList like implementation can append elements to a growing C [] array
- queue: is a Linked List FIFO
- hashmap: is a constant size vector of buckets where each element is a key value pair with custom hash and equals methods

This repository also contains hashing functions that can be used for any data structure.

## Quickstart

```console
make && ./main
```
